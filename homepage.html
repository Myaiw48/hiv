                Hello our names are Kareema, Aaliyah, Mya, and Jabari. We are apart of the science and math honors program at Smash Wharton. As part of this program, we designed a website focusing on an essential question; how to stop the spread of a disease in our community? This website targets young adults and teens in Philadelphia who are either experencenig HIV/AIDS or want to learn more about it. We included a hotline to provide people with an outlet to discuss their questions or concerns and seek advice. In addition, there is a resource page where you can test your knowledge by taking a quiz and be provided with more information such as clinics in Philadelphia.
