        HIV/AIDS (AKA Human Immunodeficiency virus/ acquired immunodefiency syndrome) is an infectious disease that interferes with the body's immune system.
         HIV/AIDS spread through bodily fluids: such as blood,semen, or vaginal fluids.
         HIV/AIDS has many symptoms.
          For example, within weeks of getting the infections you may experience flu like symtoms.
          Also, you may experience groin swelling,mouth uclers, weight loss, sweats, pain in abdomen,dry coughs ,diarrhea,headaches, etc.
          While there are cures/ vaccines for many diseases, there isn't one for HIV/AIDS.
          Since there is no cure, it can last for years or even lifelong.
          But there are treatments ( such as Antiretoroviral therapy) that can dramatically slow the disease process, prevent infections, and complications.
